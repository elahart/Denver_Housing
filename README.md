# Denver_Housing
Analyze and Model the price of houses in Denver, April 2021. 

- Gather data from Zillow to understand the relationship between distance to downtown Denver and price.  
- I discovered my initial assumption was not valid, I analyzed other features of the data. 
- I created regression models based off highly correlated features to the price of the house to determine the if the model could accurately predict the price of the house.
- My models were able to compute a R squared of 0.98 and RMSE of 40,059.
